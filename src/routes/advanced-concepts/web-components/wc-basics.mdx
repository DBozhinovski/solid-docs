[Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) is a family of standard web platform APIs which allows you to write your own reusable custom elements.
These custom elements can be used without depending on a framework being present - and as a result, they work across [most frameworks](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com). Solid supports the [usage of web components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/libraries/solid/results/results.html).

When discussing web components in the context of frameworks such as Solid, the discussion can be branched in two categories:

1. [Using web components in Solid](/using-web-components)
2. [Authoring web components via Solid](/authoring-web-components)

It's worth noting that the idea of web components doesn't always translate well to the idea of modern framework components, thus the
interoperability between the two comes with caveats which will be highlighted.

## The Shadow DOM

One of the key pieces of web components is the [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM).
The Shadow DOM allows web components to be rendered in their own DOM tree, thus being completely isolated from
the "regular" DOM. While useful, it can be a source of confusion when using web components in Solid.

```jsx
// Example here

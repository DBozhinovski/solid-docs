[Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) is a family of standard web platform APIs which allows you to write your own reusable custom elements.
These custom elements can be used without depending on a framework being present - and as a result, they work across [most frameworks](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com). Solid supports the [usage of web components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/libraries/solid/results/results.html).

When discussing web components in the context of frameworks such as Solid, the discussion can be branched in two categories:

1. [Using web components in Solid](/using-web-components)
2. [Authoring web components via Solid](/authoring-web-components)

It's worth noting that the idea of web components doesn't always translate well to the idea of modern framework components, thus the
interoperability between the two comes with caveats which will be highlighted.

## Glossary

To understand the concept of web components, it's important to understand the pieces that (can) make up a web component:

- **Custom Elements**: A class that extends the `HTMLElement` class. Put simply, the part that allows you to create a new HTML element. [More on this here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements).
- **Shadow DOM**: A set of JavaScript APIs for encapsulating DOM trees and CSS style scoping. This is the part that allows the component to be completely isolated from the rest of the DOM. [More on this here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM).
- **Templates** and **Slots**: A mechanism for declaring fragments of UI that can be reused throughout a document. As defined in the standard, slots can only be used in the shadow DOM. [More on this here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots).

## In Solid

As long as a web component [is registered in the global scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements), Solid will be able to render it.
Assuming we have a web component called `my-component`, we can use it in a Solid component like this:

```tsx
function MySolidComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<my-component />
		</div>
	);
}
```

For most intents and purposes, this should just work - the web component will be rendered much like it would in a standard HTML document. However, there are some caveats to be aware of:

- **TypeScript**: Solid will not be able to infer the type of the web component, so you'll have to bring your own type information (or import one from the web component's library you might be using). More on this [here](/using-web-components#typescript).
- **Styles**: While you can apply styles to the web component, they might not be reflected when the component is rendered - assuming the web component is using the shadow DOM, styles will be scoped to the component. More on this [here](/using-web-components#styles).
- **Events**: Generally speaking, we can separate the events emmitted by the web component in two categories:

  - **Custom events**: These are events that are emitted by the web component itself.
  - **DOM events**: These are events that are emitted by the web component's DOM, such as `click` or `submit`.

  More on the specifics of events and how they work in Solid can be found [here](/using-web-components#events).

title: Using Web Components
---

This guide provides a detailed look at using web components within Solid applications. We'll cover the various aspects of integrating web components into your Solid projects.

## Basic Usage

At a minimum, assuming we have a web component called `my-component` registered in the global scope, we can use it in Solid like this:

```tsx title="./MySolidComponent.tsx"
function MySolidComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<my-component />
		</div>
	);
}
```

<Callout>

Note that we're not importing anything when using `<my-component />`, as is the
case with regular Solid components. We just need to ensure that the web
component is registered in the global scope.

**Registering** a web component
means that the current document recognizes the tag name
`my-component` and associates it with a web component (which in turn, renders a custom element on screen).

While the details of how to register a web component are outside the scope of this
guide, the [Custom Elements API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#registering_a_custom_element)
provides more detailed documentation and examples on the topic.

Solid also has a way of creating and registering web components, which we'll cover in the [Authoring Web Components](/advanced-concepts/web-components/authoring-web-components) guide.

## TypeScript Integration

If you're using TypeScript, types usually don't work out of the box with web components. However, it's possible to add your own types, and help Solid understand the relevant type information for a web component.

### How to add type information for web components

Let's say `my-component` has a property called `message` that we want to use in Solid, in a type-safe manner. TypeScript will raise errors about two things:

- That it doesn't know about the `<my-component>` tag
- That `message` is not a valid prop for `<my-component>`

To fix this, we need to inform TypeScript about the new tag name, and the shape of the props (attributes) that `my-component` accepts:

```tsx title="./MySolidComponent.tsx"
declare module "solid-js" {
	namespace JSX {
		interface IntrinsicElements {
			"my-component": { message: string };
		}
	}
}

declare global {
	interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
		"my-component": { message: string };
	}
}
```

This type information can be colocated with the component, or in a separate file type definitions file. A full example might look like this:

```tsx title="./MySolidComponent.tsx"
function MySolidComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<my-component message="Hello, web component!" />
		</div>
	);
}

declare module "solid-js" {
	namespace JSX {
		interface IntrinsicElements {
			"my-component": { message: string };
		}
	}
}

declare global {
	interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
		"my-component": { message: string };
	}
}
```

The only two prop (or more precisely, attribute) types that web components can _natively_ "understand" are `string` and `boolean`. Any other data can be passed in as a string, but the web component will have to parse it on the other end.

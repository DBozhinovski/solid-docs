title: Authoring Web Components

This guide covers how to create web components using Solid's `solid-element` package. While Solid components and web components have different paradigms, `solid-element` provides a bridge between them.

## Getting Started

```tsx
import { customElement } from "solid-element";

customElement("my-counter", { count: 0 }, (props) => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {props.count}</p>
		</div>
	);
});
```

## The solid-element Package

- Overview of `solid-element`
- Installation and setup
- Key differences from regular Solid components

## Component Definition

### Basic Structure

- Using `customElement`
- Props definition and defaults
- Component lifecycle

### Shadow DOM

- Working with shadow DOM
- Styling within shadow DOM
- Deciding between shadow and light DOM

## Props and Attributes

### Props

- Prop types and defaults
- Reactivity

### Managing State

- Using Solid signals in web components

## Events

### Emitting Events // Mostly external links?

- Custom event creation
- Event typing
- Bubbling and composition

### Internal Event Handling

- DOM events within web components
- Event delegation strategies

## Slots and Templates

- Using slots
- Named slots

## Styling

### Shadow DOM Styling

- Component style isolation
- CSS custom properties
- Style inheritance
- CSS containment

### Light DOM Alternatives

- Styling without shadow DOM
- Global styles interaction

## Advanced Patterns

### Component Registration

- Manual vs automatic registration
- Lazy loading strategies
- Module patterns

### Performance // Might be better off as a guide?

- Optimization techniques
- Memory management
- Load time considerations

### Testing // Might be better off as a guide?
